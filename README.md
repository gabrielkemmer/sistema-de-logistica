#Real-time Package Tracking Flask App

Package Tracking

Introduction

This is a Flask web application that allows users to track their packages in real-time using data fetched from a logistic program's API. The app provides functionalities for both logged-in and non-logged-in users to track their packages with ease. It utilizes Python, Flask, and various front-end technologies to create an interactive and user-friendly experience.

Features

Real-time package tracking using data from the logistic program's API.
User authentication system (optional) to allow users to log in and track their packages more conveniently.
User-friendly interface with easy-to-use navigation and clear package status updates.
Support for multiple package tracking, allowing users to monitor more than one package simultaneously.
Responsive design, making the app accessible on various devices, including desktops, tablets, and mobile phones.
